== Introduction

This repository contains the Query meta model.

It acts as an eclipse plugin with features and sites, can be used standalone and in standard OSGi (without eclipse).

This is not an SQL model, but a model representing transformation logic for Expression-based queries. The output of this
is used later for RDBMS query generation.
